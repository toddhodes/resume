HI! I love reddit and would be happy to work with you guys.  Avast is
Prague-based, and closing the Emeryville, CA office, so, my 18 year
ride there is over, and I'm looking for my latest act in life.  Act
one was a PhD in Computer Science, which I loved.  Act two was going
through the complete lifecycle of a startup, 12 people to 200 to sale,
which was an absolute wild ride, and I loved it. For act three, I
would love to work with people who already have their own ways to do
things, not invent everything myself.  Work with experts on mature
technology, on a product I believe in.

If you are writing functional reactive kotlin for android, and have
client devs writing scripts to make dev life easier (account
management, automating daily routine, data visualization, etc), that's
what I'm best at and looking to continue doing.

Please contact me at your convenience. I am free starting in February.

Thanks and Best regards,
Todd Hodes
