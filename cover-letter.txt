Hello,

I'm a Senior/Staff Engineer who excels at writing functional reactive
Kotlin for Android, and provides ownership of the entire CI/CD build
lifecycle, feature ownership, tools & testing support, and team
technical leadership. I also love writing scripts and tools to make
dev and QA life easier -- account management, daily routine
automation, analytics accessors, data visualization, etc -- and enjoy
interacting with SysOps.

I like your product and would be excited to discuss the possibilities
of working with you.  I love working with smart, talented people of
all ages, backgrounds, and seniority on either new or mature
technology, on huge codebases, or spinning up a new one, and always
have my hands dirty in the code, leading by example.  I'm also a great
mentor for young engineers.

Please contact me at your convenience.

Thanks and Best Regards,

Todd Hodes
