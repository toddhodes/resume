HI! I love reddit and would be happy to work with you guys.  Avast is
Prague-based, and closing the Emeryville, CA office, so, my 18 year
ride there is over, and I'm looking for my latest act in life.  Act
one was a PhD in Computer Science, which I loved.  Act two was cashing
out a startup, which was an absolute wild ride, and I loved it. For act
three, I actually would love to work with people who already have
their own ways to do things, not invent everything myself.  Work with
experts on mature technology, on a product I believe in.

Please contact me at your convenience. I am free starting in February.
