	   Avast acquired AVG in 2016 and took them private.  I moved to a senior staff engineer position,
	   reporting directly to the VP of Engineering.  In addition to coding, I ran a bi-weekly developer demo
	   and showcase series.
	   Continued working on the family of white-label family safety applications for cellular
	   telephone carriers, largely on the Verizon and AT\&T products as they were the highest revenue (most important).
	   Major contributor to the 1M+ LOC Android monorepo with modules per feature and flavors for each app,
	   an overall design I helped architect.
	   Provided programming \& architecture, 
		ownership of the entire CI/CD build lifecycle, feature ownership, tools support, team 
		technical leadership. Solved ongoing ownership issues around support tooling by writing and maintaining 
		scripts to handle what no one else was willing to, in addition to all the above.

	\bf  WaveMarket, Inc.    & June 2002 -  \\
	\bf  Senior Scientist 	& June 2010 \\[4pt]
	
	   As one of the first employees at Berkeley-based WaveMarket/LocationLabs,
	   an early-stage startup that received its series A in 2001, 
	   we went from no deployed products in 2002 to an
	   acquisition by AVG Technologies in 2014.  I wore every engineering hat, starting with complete responsibility
	   for SysOps, server, and client -- writing tools and software for all three -- to
	   then specializing in Mobile Dev as we grew from a dozen engineers, added sysadmin, grew 
	   to thirty engineers, and finally to one hundred.  
	   Once iOS and Android unseated BlackBerry/J2ME/Symbian/PocketPC,
	   I specialized in Android, and, co-design of mobile architecture.  In addition to mobile dev, I provided
	   Partner Engineering/integration, visiting carriers around the world after we had signed contracts
	   with them and were hammering out integration points (authentication, location access, 
	   providing unmetered data atop metered plans, APIs/schema design, etc).
	   For details, please refer to the products highlighted in the {\bf Projects} section. \\[9pt]
       	  
    \bf Luxxon Corporation, San Jose, California. & 2000-2001 \\[3pt]
       Assisted the R\&D team, specifically
       protocols for discovery and negotiation of client
       device characteristics and media caching, in service of their media transcoding
       software and hardware. \\[9pt]

		\item 
		{\em Verizon Smart Family,
		AT\&T Secure Family, 
		T-Mobile FamilyWhere,
		Sprint Family Locator,
		Verizon FamilyBase,
		AT\&T FamilyMap}: Major contributor to 1MM+ LOC Android monorepo; programming \& architecture, 
		feature ownership, build process, infrastructure support, testing, debug support, 
		technical leadership, and related support tooling \& scripting. \\[-16pt]
		
		\item AT\&T FamilyMap Windows Phone app: Sole contributor, wrote our 
			implementation. AT\&T requested that we support it natively rather than as web-only. 
			Worked at the Microsoft campus in Redmond under NDA and security protocols
			finalizing the builds for when the OS was released.
			They loved it, app was preloaded on every Windows phone sold by AT\&T. \\[-16pt]

		\item \url{veriplace.com}: Carrier and non-carrier cell phone location as a API service. 
		A suite of thin smartphone application agents providing
		end-to-end user-plane locates (hybrid cell-sector/WiFi/GPS), with the option of using the 
		carrier networks (Verizon, AT\&T, Sprint) LPS/MLP/GMLC, or, avoiding carrier infrastructure for cost reasons.
		API/architecture, sole contributor to Windows Mobile implementation, contributor to Android/J2ME/RIM
		shared codebase.

		\item \url{streethive.com}: location-based social sharing site: StreetHive and Crunkie were social networks 
		focused on users sharing photos and text/comments atop a map. Supported on 
		handset clients (J2ME, RIM, xHTML, WAP) and web.  
		I worked on the handset client team, and shared responsibility for architecting the backend/APIs such that
		they were amenable to both web and 
		mobile content access. Java/J2ME front-end, Java/MySQL backend.

		\item \url{m.ask.com}: One of the worlds first mobile portals.  xHTML-MP/WAP access to the ask.com
		syndication backend. Provided access to full web search, 
		image search, maps with turn-by-turn directions, weather, horoscopes, and more. 
		Implemented with Java servlets/JSP + MySQL 
		by myself and one other engineer.  {\em The site won two Webby Awards in the Mobile category 
		(both Jury and People's Choice).}

		\item \url{cmprssr.com}: In order to view the resulting content discovered via queries on m.ask.com, web 
		pages needed to be transcoded from free-form HTML to valid xHTML-MP. cmprssr provided this service at
		extremely high volume (millions/day). Written in perl by myself and one other engineer.

  		\item IAC \url{gps.ask.com}: voice turn-by-turn navigation on GPS-enabled feature phones
		 to aggregated InterAactiveCorp (IAC) properties CitySearch, Evite, Ticketmaster, Ask.com. The underlying technology innovation
		  used to manage app complexity under memory and processing constraints was a declarative UI screen specification
		   augmented with novel XML-defined action flows called “chains”. These XML descriptions were compiled down
		    into primitives for efficiency, and could be updated at runtime, to overcome the lack of a ClassLoader 
		    in JavaME. 
	   
  		\item {\em MapMe} \& {\em NearHere}:
		on-handset point-of-interest finders + route generator, communicating to a custom geoserver
		backend. WaveMarket’s first handset software product releases. Responsible for hardware acquisition
		and co-location hosting,
		OS installation and configuration, sysadmin / operations, Cisco VPN to partner site, hardware load-balancing
		and failover (via Alteon ACEdirector), data integration, plus all the client and server application software itself.
		JAR code size was limited to 100KB, heap to 256KB.
