	   an early-stage startup that received its series A in 2001, 
	   we went from no deployed products to a \$220,000,000
	   acquisition by AVG LLC.  I wore every engineering hat, starting with complete responsibility
	   for SysOps, server, and client, then specializing in Mobile Dev as we grew.  
	   I specialize in Android and mobile architecture design.

Projects
\end{bf}
	   	   
	   \begin{itemize}
		\item Verizon Smart Family Android app: programming \& architecture. \\[-16pt]
		\item AT\&T Secure Family Android app: programming \& architecture.  \\[-16pt]
		\item T-Mobile FamilyWhere Android app: programming \& architecture.  \\[-16pt]
		\item Sprint Family Locator Android app: programming \& architecture.   \\[-16pt]

		\item Verizon FamilyBase Android app: programming \& architecture.   \\[-16pt]
		\item AT\&T FamilyMap Android app: programming \& architecture  \\[-16pt]
		\item AT\&T FamilyMap Windows Phone app: Sole contributor, wrote our 
			implementation. AT\&T requested that we support it natively rather than as web-only. 
			Worked at the Microsoft campus in Redmond under NDA and security protocols
			finalizing the builds for when the OS was released.
			They loved it, app was a preload on every Windows phone in the AT\&T store. \\[-16pt]

		\item \url{veriplace.com}: Carrier and non-carrier cell phone location as a API service. 
		A suite of thin smartphone application agents providing
		end-to-end user-plane locates (hybrid cell-sector/WiFi/GPS), with the option of using the 
		carrier networks (Verizon, AT\&T, Sprint) LPS/MLP/GMLC, or, avoiding carrier infrastructure for cost reasons.
		API/architecture, sole contributor to Windows Mobile implementation, contributor to Android/J2ME/RIM
		shared codebase.

		\item \url{streethive.com}: location-based social sharing site: StreetHive and Crunkie were social networks 
		focused on users sharing photos and text/comments atop a map. Supported on 
		handset clients (J2ME, RIM, xHTML, WAP) and web.  
		I worked on the handset client team, and shared responsibility for architecting the backend/APIs such that
		they were amenable to both web and 
		mobile content access. Java/J2ME front-end, Java/MySQL backend.

		\item \url{m.ask.com}: One of the worlds first mobile portals.  xHTML-MP/WAP access to the ask.com
		syndication backend. Provided access to full web search, 
		image search, maps with turn-by-turn directions, weather, horoscopes, and more. 
		Implemented with Java servlets/JSP + MySQL 
		by myself and one other engineer.  The site won the Webby Award in the Mobile category.

		\item \url{cmprssr.com}: In order to view the resulting content discovered via queries on m.ask.com, web 
		pages needed to be transcoded from free-form HTML to valid xHTML-MP. cmprssr provided this service at
		extremely high volume (millions/day). Written in perl by myself and one other engineer.

  		\item IAC \url{gps.ask.com}: voice turn-by-turn navigation on GPS-enabled feature phones
		 to aggregated InterAactiveCorp (IAC) properties CitySearch, Evite, Ticketmaster, Ask.com. The underlying technology innovation
		  used to manage app complexity under memory and processing constraints was a declarative UI screen specification
		   augmented with novel XML-defined action flows called “chains”. These XML descriptions were compiled down
		    into primitives for efficiency, and could be updated at runtime, to overcome the lack of a ClassLoader 
		    in JavaME. 
	   
  		\item {\em MapMe} \& {\em NearHere}:
		on-handset point-of-interest finders + route generator, communicating to a custom geoserver
		backend. WaveMarket’s first handset software product releases. Responsible for hardware acquisition
		and co-location hosting,
		OS installation and configuration, sysadmin / operations, Cisco VPN to partner site, hardware load-balancing
		and failover (via Alteon ACEdirector), data integration, plus all the client and server application software itself.
		JAR code size was limited to 100KB, heap to 256KB.
