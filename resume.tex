	   We white-label family safety applications for cellular telephone carriers.
	   As one of the first handful of employees at Berkeley-based LocationLabs,
	   an early-stage series A startup, we went from no products and no income, to a \$220,000,000
	   acquisition by AVG LLC.  I wore every engineering hat, starting with complete responsibility
	   for SysOps, server, and client, and then specializing in Mobile Dev as we grew.  My title started
	   as Senior Scientist, became Director of Engineering and Director of
	   Mobile Technologies, and settled on specializing in Android and mobile architecture design / API schema.
	   AVG was eventually acquired by Avast corp, where I continued on the engineering team as
	   Senior Staff Engineer, giving up the Director of Engineering title to focus on architecture and technical
	   leadership.

		\item Verizon Smart Family: Android architecture \& client team. \\[-16pt]
		\item AT\&T Secure Family: Android architecture \& client team. \\[-16pt]

Sample previous projects:

	   \begin{itemize}
		\item AT\&T FamilyMap: Android architecture \& client team / Windows Phone 7 sole contributor.  \\[-16pt]
		\item Verizon FamilyBase: Android architecture \& client team.  \\[-16pt]

		\item \url{veriplace.com} Sparkle location-as-a-service: A suite of thin smartphone application agents providing
		end-to-end user-plane locates (hybrid cell-sector/WiFi/GPS), avoiding carrier infrastructure for cost reasons.
		API/architecture, sole contributor to Windows Mobile implementation, contributor to Android/J2ME/RIM
		shared codebase.

		\item \url{streethive.com}: location-based social sharing site, focused on situating posts (photos/comments) atop a map. J2ME handset client, web.  and shared responsibility for architecting the backend/APIs so that they were amenable to both web and mobile content access. Java backend with MySQL.

		\item \url{m.ask.com}: xHTML-MP/WAP portal access to ask.com syndication backend. Web search, images search, maps/directions, weather, horoscopes, etc. Implemented with Java servlets/JSP + MySQL by myself and one other engineer.  The site won the Webby Award in the Mobile category.

		\item \url{cmprssr.com}: In order to view the resulting content discovered via queries on m.ask.com, web pages needed to be transcoded from free-form HTML to valid xHTML-MP. cmprssr provided this service at extremely high volume (millions/day). Written in perl by myself and one other engineer.

  		\item InterActiveCorp / IAC \url{gps.ask.com}: voice turn-by-turn navigation on GPS-enabled feature phones to aggregated IAC properties CitySearch, Evite, Ticketmaster, Ask.com. The underlying technology innovation used to manage app complexity under memory and processing constraints was a declarative UI screen specification augmented with novel XML-defined action flows called “chains”. These XML descriptions were compiled down into primitives for efficiency, and could be updated at runtime, to overcome the lack of a ClassLoader in JavaME (pre-MIDP3.0). 
	   
  		\item MapMe: on-handset point-of-interest finders + route generator, communicating to a custom geoserver backend. WaveMarket’s first handset software product releases. Responsible for hardware acquisition and co-location hosting, OS installation and configuration, sysadmin / operations, Cisco VPN to partner site, hardware load-balancing and failover (via Alteon ACEdirector), data integration, plus all the client and server application software itself. Code size was limited to 100KB, heap to 256KB.
